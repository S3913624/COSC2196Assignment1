    Interest in IT
  </h3>
 <p>I love the problem-solving nature of IT and it is my opinion that IT really has no purpose other than to solve a problem, however minute that problem may be. How do I get this document to a colleague in another country? How can I watch any program I want, when I want? I’ve run out of rocks to throw. Surely there’s some sort of technology to cure my boredom!

 <p>My earliest memory of actively trying to solve a problem using IT was in middle school. I had an old laptop that I had completed an assignment on, but for some reason the printer port would not recognize the printer. When I connected the printer to another PC I could print just fine. I rummaged through the drawer full of cables that everyone has and found a network switch. I’d never tried my hand at networking before, but I managed to set up a basic network and print my assignment for submission. Setting up the network was not without its own dramas, and in hindsight there were much more suitable solutions (thumb drive…), but for me it was more about the challenge of solving the problem in a way that I could also learn something from too. It is this fascination with problem-solving that had sparked my interest in IT, and thus my desire to pursue higher education in IT.

 <p>Upon deciding to pursue higher education, I reached out to Open Universities Australia. I was unable to specifically tell them my interests other than that I enjoyed computers and technology. They presented me with options based on this rather unhelpful answer and upon perusing the RMIT course structure, it appeared to offer an incredibly broad range of subjects which could help focus my interest. Partnered with RMIT’s well respected and innovative reputation, there was really no other choice.

 <p>Broadly speaking, studying this particular higher education course through RMIT will teach me how to be a better team player. It is expected I will learn some hard lessons about time management given full time work commitments, extracurricular commitments and family commitments. I hope to gain a better insight and understanding of a whole range of IT fields and expect to build on some basic knowledge. I aim to find out specifically what fields I am interested in and what fields I excel in. Perhaps networking? It was a thrilling experience getting the basic network to communicate properly, and finally print my assignment all those years ago.
