  <H3>Reflection Analysis</H3>
    <p>It is my opinion that most personality tests should be taken with a shred of skepticism. Humans are nuanced and don’t just fall into a category, so any test that pertains to categorize someone is as a result flawed, as it is just not flexible enough. Regardless, it was impressive how close to home a majority of the results came. Overall, the results of all three tests were eerily consistent and I can safely agree with them. Positively speaking the results highlighted in particular a reliable, organized and practical personality. Negatively, it defined me as more of a shy, modest and insensitive person.</p>
    <p>Being reliable, organized and practical is important when it comes to working in a team. Combined with an altruistic attitude, acting selflessly for the greater good of the team can both help with achieving deadlines and avoid conflict. managing weaker traits can be difficult however. In order to maintain a healthy team relationship, it will be critical for me to speak up when perhaps the direction of the group is questionable, but also to remain sensitive and considerate to other people’s skills, attitudes and experiences.</p>
    <p>When forming teams, these skills, attitudes, experiences and specifically the results of a personal attribute test can be applied to define the optimal group. It’s particularly important to strive for a diverse range of personalities, as a diverse team can offset imbalances in the group. When negative emotions begin to fester, more sociable team members can help minimize conflict and maintain morale. the flip side to this is that an assertive and organized team member can help keep the team stay focused and meet deadlines.</p>
