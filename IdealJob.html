    <h4>
    Overview
  </h4>
  <p>The role is for a network engineer and the successful candidate will be made responsible for supporting a range of infrastructure and platforms including data technology, voice and security systems, and customer service facilities. Specifically, this will involve monitoring for and correcting network issues, documenting steps to correct issues, and engage with IT Service Management Systems I.e., ticketing systems and helpdesk/service tools.

  <p>The role is ideal not because it’s an end-game aspiration, but because it appears to be a bit more of an entry-level position despite requiring some experience. Being aimed at less seasoned IT professionals, the roll has the potential to offer an enormous amount of exposure to the IT industry. It is a two-year max-term roll, implying that the candidate will have ample opportunity for promotion to an area they have perhaps shown further interest or aptitude for. The role is appealing as it requires a serious problem-solving nature and is an opportunity to learn and ‘commit to continuous improvement’.
  <h4>
    Required Skills and Qualifications
  </h4>
  <p>The potential candidate must be able to demonstrate several skills and must have obtained as a minimum the following:
  <br>
    <ul>
      <li>A bachelor’s in engineering, computer science or other science, technology, engineering or mathematics related field.</li>
      <li>Certified in ITIL V4, which is defined as the Information Technology Infrastructure Library. ITIL is a framework for managing IT service delivery. It is a quality management system for businesses, to ensure their services are delivered to a high standard.</li>
      <li>CISCO CCNA certified. Cisco is the certifying body while CCNA is the level or grade and stands for Cisco Certified Network Associate. There are a range of topic options within the CCNA certificate, including voice, video, cloud, industrial, wireless, data center, service provider and routing and switching.</li>
      <li>Experience working in a network operations center (NOC), with particular experience handling data and voice network faults.</li>
      <li>Experience with Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), which is used to avoid complex network addresses by using short labels instead, and routing traffic through virtual links rather than sending traffic directly to the end point.</li>
      <li>Experience with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which applies to the dynamic routing of network traffic based on policy, traffic levels, bandwidth and reliability of the system.</li>
      <li>Exceptional customer service skills.</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>
    Plan of Attack
  </h4>
  <p>Regrettably, I would not currently be considered suitable for this role. Despite my keen interest in the problem-solving aspect as a whole I lack all qualifications and most experience. Apart from exceptional customer service skills, developed through almost a decade in technical sales and service, it is a role that would need to be worked towards. The journey however has begun. By completing the Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT, the first prerequisite, and frankly the most time consuming and difficult prerequisite will have been achieved.

  <p>The ITIL V4 certificate would be the next step and can obtained by completing a three-day full time or three-week part time/weekend course and passing the examination. This is offered by many recognized training authorities, but itroute appears to be reputable based on testimonies and reviews. It is also a geographically local organization.

  <p>The Cisco CCNA certificate is obtained through Cisco directly, by passing the 200-301 examination. Although the examination does not require completed coursework as a prerequisite, it is recommended and again available through Cisco directly who offer Virtual instructor-led training or an E-learning option.

  <p>In order to obtain exposure to MPLS and BGP, Cisco again offer certificates. The Cisco CCIP (Cisco Certified Internetworking Professional) certificate cover MPLS and BGP as part of the learning outcomes.

<p>Social networking will be important in obtaining experience. IT is a collaborative industry, and often a role is afforded to people of reputation rather than experience. Conveniently I have many colleagues in the industry, one of whom used to work at Macquarie Telecom, currently works at an internationally renowned company, and has offered to provide testimony to my character, hard work and ability. This is not something to rely on however, and it will still likely be necessary to start at the bottom. I.e., volunteer, intern or obtain further certification.
